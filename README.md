Customer Churn Analysis in Telecom â€“ Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset, "Telco Customer Churn." Churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing services, is a significant challenge for telecom providers, as acquiring new customers is costlier than retaining existing ones. The goal of this analysis is to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and build predictive models to classify users who are likely to churn.

The dataset consists of customer demographics, account information, usage metrics, and service details. The initial steps involved data cleaning, where invalid entries in the Total Charges column were handled, and redundant columns such as CustomerID, Lat Long, and geographical data were removed due to their limited relevance or high granularity. Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder, and selected numerical features like Monthly Charges, Total Charges, CLTV, and Churn Score were standardized for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) included churn distribution visualizations, correlation heatmaps, and tenure/charge-based plots to uncover behavioral patterns. For modeling, the dataset was split into training and test sets. Two classification algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports were used to assess the performance of both models. The Random Forest model slightly outperformed logistic regression and provided feature importance rankings, highlighting the most influential predictors of churn.

This project offers actionable insights for telecom companies to target at-risk customers, optimize retention strategies, and enhance overall service delivery.
